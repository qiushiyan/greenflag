/**
 * The framing — the one file the human writes per run, and the only place
 * project knowledge enters the system. This module owns its whole journey:
 * the seed template (the built-in default, or a project's own
 * `.greenflag/templates/<name>.md` selected with `--template`), the bare-`greenflag new`
 * editor flow, the machine/prose frontmatter boundary, and the resolution of
 * CLI flags against frontmatter into a run's inputs. A template is just
 * pre-baked framing — it seeds the editor draft and is then parsed and
 * archived like any framing, so the framing turn stays the single entry seam.
 *
 * The frontmatter boundary rule (settled 2026-06-12, see
 * docs/automation-design.md §"Gate pre-authorization"): a key belongs in
 * frontmatter only when its practical expression is a FIXED VALUE and a
 * DETERMINISTIC CONSUMER (the harness) acts on it without judgment. If the
 * value is natural language with riders, or the consumer is the orchestrator
 * applying judgment, it stays in the prose body. Spec/plan locations,
 * verification posture, skills: prose, always — the planlab
 * run is the evidence (the framing's literal spec dir was wrong relative to
 * the worktree root and judgment resolved it).
 *
 * Current keys: `gates_at`, `spec`. Pre-approved for later: `budget_usd`,
 * if open-questions Q19 resolves in favor of a run-level budget model.
 *
 * Frontmatter is parsed at `greenflag new` and STRIPPED before the framing body
 * is embedded in the orchestrator's prompt — the orchestrator sees only the
 * rendered posture instructions, never the raw config, so there is exactly
 * one source of truth in its context.
