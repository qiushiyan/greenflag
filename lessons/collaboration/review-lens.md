# The Review Lens

The stance for reviewing another engineer's change — whoever wrote it, whatever
harness dispatched you. It governs what counts as a finding and what earns
approval. The prompt that
dispatched you carries the run's contract — the severity ladder, the output
format, which decisions are settled — and this lesson never overrides it.

## The bar

Skim these as a lens; the sections below carry the why.

- **Step back before judging locally.** The default reviewer failure is
  tactical: accept the implementation's framing and optimize inside it — the
  extra argument, the patched conditional, the fix that works. Before endorsing
  any local fix, ask whether reshaping the design dissolves the problem
  instead: a new module or helper, a shared component extracted, a function
  redesigned around a different contract, the pieces wired together
  differently. Propose the reshape when you see one; when nothing reshapes
  cleanly, the local finding is the right one.
- **Judge how the change joins the design.** Separate from whether it works:
  did the concepts already there absorb the new case, or did it get its own
  route beside them — a flag, a wrapper, a parallel function, a second
  mechanism answering a question the first one already answers? Trace one real
  path the change serves, entry to effect, and name what each hop adds; the hop
  that adds nothing is a finding, and so is the layer that speaks its caller's
  vocabulary back to it. Do this on the small contained fixes too — a bolt-on
  hides best in the range nobody thinks to trace. The vocabulary is
  [`../codebase-design/composition.md`](../codebase-design/composition.md); the
  counterweight is the next bullet, since a reshape proposed for a caller that
  doesn't exist yet is the same additive bias one altitude up.
- **Hold requested tests to the additive-bias bar.** Asking for another test is
  cheap, always defensible, and looks rigorous — a missing test is visible
  today; a superfluous one bills the future, and never to you. A test you
  request must name the bug it would catch and confirm no existing test already
  catches it; a test worth deleting is a finding too. (What earns a place in a
  suite: [`../testing/test-quality.md`](../testing/test-quality.md).)
- **Over-building is the likelier failure.** Defensive branches for states that
  can't occur, fallbacks the invariants already rule out, features or config
  beyond the settled scope, abstractions pulled out before the pattern is real.
  Prefer a state made unrepresentable (a type, constructor, or enum) or one
  validation boundary over more handling — a request for more handling must
  name the reachable state it guards.
- **Chesterton's fence.** Where a change looks wrong, work out what the author
  was doing before judging it — odd-looking code often encodes a constraint you
  haven't hit yet. And where it is genuinely wrong, knowing the intent is what
  lets a fix keep what the intent got right.
- **Seam cleanliness.** Casts, `any`/`unknown`, optionality papering over an
  unclear invariant — the finding is the missing explicit contract.
- **Preparatory refactoring** (when the change includes one) is
  behavior-preserving and proportionate — sized to this change, not a rewrite
  smuggled in alongside it.
- **Findings are evidence-backed.** Read the actual code, not just the diff — a
  diff hides the surrounding context that decides whether a change is right.
  Cite the code that proves each finding and give a concrete fix; a "could be
  cleaner" names the cleaner shape or isn't reported. The one finding that
  needs no code behind it is a violated expectation: where a brief hands you
  the goal and withholds the design, report the surprise as expectation plus
  observation — you are the read the next maintainer will get.
- **Grade the artifact, not the account of it.** The spec, the plan, the commit
  messages, and the implementer's report say what was *intended*; only the code
  says what happens, so a claim in a document is never evidence the behavior
  exists. Where the two disagree the code wins, and the disagreement is its own
  finding — a document describing behavior that isn't there. Where the range
  has no code at all (a spec, a doc, a skill), the artifact is the shipped
  text and the rule holds one level up: read it as its reader will, not as its
  author narrates it.
- **Judge by the standard the work was built to.** When the brief hands you a
  rulebook the implementer worked under — a house guide, a project doc, a
  rubric — that is the bar, ahead of your own defaults. Read it before
  reviewing; a finding that contradicts a standard the work deliberately
  followed is a disagreement with the standard, and belongs in that form.
- **Approval is earned by the design, not just working behavior.** Structural
  regressions and missed reshapes block; they are not nits.

## Why strategic beats tactical

A reviewer who accepts the implementation's framing converges on the local
optimum: each finding improves the code as shaped, and none asks whether the
shape is the problem. Reshapes are where review buys the most — the change that
deletes a concept (a branch, a mode, a helper layer) outranks the one that
tidies it — and they are exactly what the author, deep inside their own
framing, is least positioned to see. Two vocabularies carry the findings, and
structural findings are written in their terms: depth, seams, the deletion
test, and illegal states, for one module against its callers, in
[`../codebase-design/deep-modules.md`](../codebase-design/deep-modules.md);
pass-throughs, accretion, connascence across a seam, and the lava layer, for
the path *between* modules, in
[`../codebase-design/composition.md`](../codebase-design/composition.md).

## Why the additive bias needs naming

Review has an asymmetry: for the reviewer, adding is safer than judging. Every
"add a test / add handling / add a guard" is defensible in isolation, and its
cost lands later, on someone else. So the drift is systematic, not occasional —
toward more coverage instead of judging the coverage that exists, more handling
instead of asking whether the state is reachable. Naming the bias is what makes
it checkable: before filing an additive finding, name what it catches and what
it costs. It is the step-back rule at a second altitude — judge the framing
before optimizing inside it — and a review that holds both produces fewer
findings, each heavier.
